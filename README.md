# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice in TypeScript

Welcome to my personal repository dedicated to learning and practicing data structures and algorithms using TypeScript. This is a comprehensive collection of common problems, each implemented to enhance my understanding of the fundamental principles of computer science.

This repository is a great way for me to brush up on coding skills, prepare for interviews, or simply refresh my knowledge around core computer science concepts.

## Repository Structure

The structure is organized into different categories of problems such as Backtracking, Dynamic Programming, Graphs, Trees, Sorting and Searching algorithms, and many more.

## Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms form the backbone of Computer Science and are indispensable tools in a programmer's toolkit. This collection of problems is intended to provide a practical approach to understanding these concepts by solving problems and implementing solutions in TypeScript.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, simply clone it to your local machine, install the necessary dependencies, and you're good to go. Here's how you start:

```bash
npm install
npx ts-node src/path/to/file.ts
```

## Code Overview

Here's a quick overview of what you'll find in this repository:

- [Backtracking](src/back-tracking)
  - [Combinations Finder](src/back-tracking/CombinationsFinder.ts)
  - [Permutations Finder](src/back-tracking/PermutationsFinder.ts)
  - [Knight's Tour](src/back-tracking/KnightsTour.ts)

> **Note:** This list will continue to grow as I add more solutions to the repository.
